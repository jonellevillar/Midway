#Introduction 

DNA methylation occurs when a methyl group is added to the 5-carbon of a cytosine ring, resulting in 5-methylcytosine (5-mC). This addition occurs most often in the context of a CpG site, which is a cytosine nucleotide located proximal to a guanidine nucleotide.

Throughout the genome, the majority of CpG sites are methylated, with the exception of CpG islands in the germline and near promoter regions, which are largely unmethylated and associated with gene expression. MicroRNA (miRNA), small noncoding RNA (ncRNA), and transfer RNA (tRNA) also can exert posttranscriptional control over gene expression. Modiﬁcations of Nterminal tail amino acids in histones H3 and H4, such as methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination, are associated with open- and closed- chromatin states.Depending on location, histone methylation may enhance or suppress gene expression @Hammoud2009.

  Complex landscape of epigenetic mechanisms. (A) DNA can be modified at cytosine and adenine residues by the addition of chemical groups. Cytosines can be modified by methylation, hydroxymethylation (hmC), formylation (fC), and carboxylation (caC), while adenines are modified by methylation. (B) Nucleosomes, composed of DNA wrapped around histone proteins, can change position to increase or decrease DNA accessibility. In addition, nucleosomes can be modified by the incorporation of histone variants and the addition of posttranslational modifications. (C) Noncoding RNAs play an important role in transcription regulation and are sometimes considered an epigenetic mechanism. Within RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs), miRNAs mediate the recognition and binding of RNAs that become targeted for degradation. lncRNAs are associated with other complexes and can activate or repress transcription. (D) All RNA nucleotides can be modified by the addition of chemical groups. The list of RNA modifications includes N6-methyladenosine (m6A) and over 160 other chemical modifications.

  ## **Circadian Rhythms**¨
  
  Circadian rhythms are physical, mental and behavioral variations that follow an approximately 24-hour cycle in response to the periodic alternation between day and night.

In optimal conditions of youth and health, most—if not all—physiological systems obey regular circadian rhythms in response to the periodic day-night cycle and can be well described by standard techniques such as cosinor analysis. Adverse conditions can disturb the regularity and amplitude of circadian cycles, and, recently, there is interest in the field of chronobiology to quantify irregularities in the circadian rhythm as a means to track underlying pathologies @Fossion2018

In the last few decades, it has become well established that most—if not all—physiological systems exhibit these regular circadian rhythms, and it has been discovered that they are largely controlled by a central clock and several peripheral oscillators [1]. More recently, it has been observed that adverse conditions, such as “healthy” and pathological aging, illness, stress and medication use, can disturb the regularity and amplitude of the circadian rhythm. (Ibid)

#Symptoms of Psychosis 

Two of the main symptoms are delusions and hallucinations. Delusions are false beliefs, an can include thoughts that the TV is sending you signals or someone is plotting against you. Hallucinations are false perceptions, such as hearing, seeing, or feeling something that is not there. People with Major depressive disorder can experience psychotic symptoms. 
Trouble thinking clearly or concentrating.

Schizophrenia is one type of psychotic disorder. People with bipolar disorder may also have psychotic symptoms
Suspiciousness or unease around others.
Lack of self-care or hygiene.
Spending more time alone than usual.
Stronger emotions than situations call for.
No emotions at all.
