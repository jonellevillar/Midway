###Technical Challenges <br>

.bitty[
- Currently no standardized pipeline for QC and EWAS (including DMRs and pathway analyses). <br><br>
- EPIC probes biased for cancer genes. <br> <br>
- EWAS literature (2011- 2020): <br><br>
    - 47% pertains to Illumina 450K; <br><br>
    - < 7% pertains to EPIC (Wei _et al.,_ 2021) <br><br>
- Small sample sizes may lack power. <br> <br>
- Large meta-analyses may have different study designs or methods.

- 1st generation: Case-Control (Rakyan, _et al._, 2011) <br> <br>
- 2nd generation: Cellular heterogeneity (Jaffe & Irizarry, 2014, Lappalainen & Greally, 2017) <br> <br>
- 3rd generation: Temporal dimension: "chrono-epigenetics" (Oh, E. & Petronis, 2021)
