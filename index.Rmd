###Technical / Scientific / Personal Challenges <br> <br>

.bitty[
- Prior to COVID-19 lockdown, NORMENT projects were moved to a secure platform (TSD). <br> <br>
 - Months of delays occurred when upgrades were made to the servers and our data was moved to the new servers. <br> <br> 
 - We were often shut out of TSD and could not access the data. <br> <br>  
 - Technical support in Oslo was short-handed early in the lockdown. <br> <br>
- COVID-19 lockdown: home office for 18 months was challenging.

###**General aim of this PhD work**
.enlarge[
 - To identify epigenetic marks associated with psychosis and treatment effects. <br />
]

###**Specific aims**
.bitty[
- **Paper 1**: Is the association of SCZ vs. controls on cell-type proportions impacted by time-of-blood draw? <br> <br />
- **Paper 2**: What common and specific DNAm marks are seen following antipsychotic drug treatment for psychosis? <br> <br />
- **Paper 3**: Do we see disorder specific DNAm in SCZ vs. BPD? <br> <br />
- **Paper 3**: Are these disorder specific DNAm marks associated with development in SCZ & BPD?

## **Epigenetics**

---


###Epigenetics in psychiatric disorders  <br> <br> 

.bitty[
- Development: prenatal environmental factors _in utero_ <br> <br>
- MZ twins discordant for SCZ/BPD (Dempster, _et al._, 2011) <br> <br>
- Dynamic; many environmental exposures - trauma, adversity, life-style <br> <br>
- Associated with brain volume, structure and function; <br> <br>
    - social and cognitive function (Starnawska & Demontis, 2021) <br> <br>
- DNAm changes overtime as a function of age and chronicity of the disorder 
]


---
### The Data  (N = 2365)

.bitty[
- TOP cohort (NORMENT): recruitment and blood samples <br> <br>
- DNA sent in three batches to Bonn for typing <br> <br>
- State-of-the art **Illumina EPIC 850K** microarray <br> <br>
- First PCA showed big batch effects <br> <br>
- QC: each batch separately and then merged the three <br> <br>
- PCA: technical replicates in each batch clustered close to each other <br> <br>

###Project 1

###Does time-of-blood draw impact the association of SCZ vs. controls on cell-type proportions?

.pull-right[.footnote[Eugène Gabritschevsky, _Untitled_,1947]

###Circadian rhythms and "chrono-epigenetics" <br> <br> 

.bitty[
- Methyl cycle co-evolved with circadian clocks (Fustin, _et al._, 2020) <br> <br>
- Circadian rhythms are disrupted in serious mental disorders (Walker II, _et al._, 2020) <br> <br>
- Chrono-epigenetics: <br> <br>
    - temporal dynamics of epigenetic processes <br> <br>
    - oscillating CpGs contribute to epigenetic variability (Oh, E. & Petronis, 2021)

###Method of analysis 

.bitty[
Pre-step: Estimated cell-type proportions from DNAm data (Salas, _et al._, 2018) <br> <br>

]


.bitty[
1. Selected European SCZ cases & controls with recorded time-of-blood draw (n=729) <br> <br>
1. Calculated variable “hours from 07:00 baseline” <br> <br>
1. Samples matched for age and sex <br> <br>
1. Compared full day vs. half day <br> <br>
1. Sub-analyses: Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and medication-free SCZ cases

###Distribution of recorded blood draws (n=729)


- Model 1: Cell-type proportions ~  Case_Control + Age + Sex + Smoking_score + Methbatch + 𝜺
- Model 2: Cell-type proportions ~ Case_Control + Age + Sex + Smoking_score + Methbatch + Hours_from_baseline + 𝜺

###Results

.pull-right[

###Full day (n=729)

.bitty[
- P-values reduced significance in Model 2
- Effect sizes diminished in Model 2
]

###Half day (n=524)

.bitty[
- P-values: no significant change 
- Effect sizes: no change

###Results Sub-analyses 

.bitty[
- NLR: <br> <br>
    - significant association in all analyses (_p_ <.001); <br> <br>
    - modest increase in mean NLR in half-day medication-free samples; i.e. <br> <br>
      - unadjusted mean NLR (.93) vs. adjusted mean NLR  (1.14) <br> <br>
- Medication-free cases: significant for neutrophils and CD4T adjusted/unadjusted (_p_ <.01)
]

###Conclusion Project 1:
.bitty[
**In DNAm studies, correcting for cell-type proportions will reduce epigenetic variation associated with time-of-blood draw and the circadian cycling of white blood cells.**

### Pharmacoepigenetic findings in psychiatry 

.bitty[
- Early stages still: <br> <br>
  - Study design, technology, patient population, lack of replication <br> <br>
  - No uniform identification of hyper- or hypo-methylation (i.e. _COMT_, _5-HTT_, _HTR2A_) (Burghardt, _et al._, 2020, Zhou _et al_, 2021) <br> <br>
  - Lacking studies of AP monotherapy (Burghardt, _et al._, 2020) <br> <br>
  - DNAm associated with both the pathology and treatment (Jaffe, _et al._, 2016) <br> <br>
  - "Tissue issue" - relevance of peripheral blood (Bakulski, _et al._, 2016)

###Correlation blood-brain DNAm  <br> 

.bitty[
- Technological improvements:  450K vs. EPIC (850K)  
- Blood / live brain-tissue samples:      r = 0.86 
- CpGs identified within promoter: r = 0.92
]

###Methods <br> 

.bitty[
1. Select European SCZ, BPD and MDD cases being treated with antipsychotics <br> <br>
1. Select samples with blood drawn within 4 months of interview date <br> <br>
1. **Common**: Compare AP-use vs. non AP-use   <br> <br>
1. **Specific**: Contrast mono-therapy against non-target polytherapy.  <br> <br>
1. Model: DNAm ~ Psychosis_Cases + Age + Sex + Smoking_score + eCells + Technical + 𝜺<br> <br>
1. Identify CpGs (_limma_), associated genes (_Illumina annotation_), and DMRs (_Comb-p_) <br> <br>
1. GSEA and pathway analysis (GREAT) <br> <br>
